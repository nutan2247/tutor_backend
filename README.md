## Documentation

The documentation for the CoreUI Admin Template is hosted at our website [CoreUI for Angular](https://coreui.io/angular/)

---

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.0.

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, CoreUI Free Admin Template is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/).

See [the Releases section of our project](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-angular-admin-template/releases) for changelogs for each release version.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Support CoreUI Development

CoreUI is an MIT-licensed open source project and is completely free to use.

You can support development by buying the [CoreUI PRO](https://coreui.io/pricing/) or by becoming a sponsor via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/coreui/).
